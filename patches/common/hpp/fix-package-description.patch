-See the README for usage examples.
+hpp is a Haskell pre-processor that is also a C90-compatible pre-processor
+(with the addition of a --cpp flag). It is packaged as both a library and an
+executable.
+
+To use as a Haskell preprocessor for resolving #ifdef conditionals and macro
+#expansion, an invocation might look like:
+
+    hpp -DDEBUG Foo.hs
+
+To use as a C preprocessor, an invocation might look like,
+
+    hpp -DDEBUG --cpp foo.c
+
+To have GHC use hpp as the C pre-processor, add this line to the top of a
+Haskell source file that makes use of the CPP LANGUAGE pragma,
+
+    {-# OPTIONS_GHC -cpp -pgmPhpp #-}
+
+Or add this line to your .cabal file:
+
+    ghc-options: -pgmPhpp
+
+Note that you will need to ensure that the hpp executable is available in your
+build environment (e.g. you can add hpp as a build-depends in your .cabal
+file).
