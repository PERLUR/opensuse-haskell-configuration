-See <http://documentup.com/haskell-suite/haskell-packages>.
+This library provides Cabal integration for compiler writers, i.e. it
+implements command line option parsing, Cabal support, and package management:
+
+* Parsing command line parameters. Sounds easy â€” just take a list of files to
+  compile. In reality you also need to handle package ids and package dbs, CPP
+  options (-DFOO=1), language extension flags (-XRankNTypes) etc.
+
+* Retrieve the list of installed packages, supported languages and extensions
+  etc.
+
+* Pretend that you are GHC or other compiler that is already supported by
+  Cabal.
+
+* Implement a package db mechanism, which lets you to keep track of installed
+  packages.
+
+All you need to do is to provide the function to do actual compilation and tell
+a couple of other things about your compiler. See the
+Distribution.HaskellSuite.Compiler module for details.
