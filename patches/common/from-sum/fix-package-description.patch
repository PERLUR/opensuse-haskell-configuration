-Provides many functions for working with 'Maybe' and 'Either', including
-canonical 'fromMaybeM' and 'fromEitherM' functions. Please see 'README.md'.
+This Haskell module exports the "fromEitherM" and "fromMaybeM" convenience
+functions
+
+  fromMaybeM :: Applicative m => m a -> Maybe a -> m a
+  fromEitherM :: Applicative m => (e -> m a) -> Either e a -> m a
+
+that lift "either" and "maybe" to Applicative values.
