-Send textual messages to a Handle in a thread-friendly way.
+Send textual messages to a Handle in a thread-friendly way. The functions
+provided in this library guarantee the following properties:
+
+  - Properly handle character encoding settings on the Handle.
+
+  - For reasonably sized messages, ensure that the entire message is written in
+    one chunk to avoid interleaving data with other threads. (This includes the
+    trailing newline character.)
+
+  - Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies
+
+  - Minimize locking.
