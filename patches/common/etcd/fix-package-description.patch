-See <https://coreos.com/using-coreos/etcd/>.
+etcd is a distributed key value store that provides a reliable way to store
+data across a cluster of machines. Itâ€™s open-source and available on GitHub.
+etcd gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and will
+tolerate machine failure, including the leader.
+
+Your applications can read and write data into etcd. A simple use-case is to
+store database connection details or feature flags in etcd as key value pairs.
+These values can be watched, allowing your app to reconfigure itself when they
+change.
+
+Advanced uses take advantage of the consistency guarantees to implement
+database leader elections or do distributed locking across a cluster of
+workers.
